# smart_attendance

A Cross Platform Attendance pplication.

# Brief Description : 
A cross platform app for a University / Institute which will convert the Classic Attendance system (which would take 10+ minutes) to a QR code based Modern System. In this the lecturer will create a session with app inputting the Course code and Class code and then click a button to generate a QR code (and project the same to projector). Then the students in the class just need to scan it with the app, and they will be marked present. Also the teacher can view the live attendance and can toggle their attendance by a click. Also the teacher and students can view their pass lectures taken and attended respectively.
